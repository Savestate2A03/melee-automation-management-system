--- scene function 0x801a4014

initially
r3 is pointer to scene function args struct?
r5 is pointer to pointer table?
0x0010 from r3 contains pointer to pointer table of scene functions?
r4 ?? specific scene ?
255 - r4, and move to ctr register
if >= 255, skip a bunch of code

move the pointer to pointer table (r5) into r6
and clear out r3

load byte at r6 into r0
if not equal to 255 then branch backwareds

and compare r4 to r0
if not equal, branch down
and add 24 to r6 (pointer to pointer table)
add 1 into r3 (init zero)
if r0 != 255, go back to comparing r4 to r0

if r4 == r0, 
multiply r3 by 24 and put into r0
add r5 (pointer to pointer table) and r0, and store in r27

r5 contains pointer to pointer table of scene sub functions?
r27 -> r3 becomes pointer to the arguments for sub function

move 0x0003(0x80480000-0x62D0) into r0 (why?)

do scene setup? (branch to other function)

load scene sub function from sub function arguments 0x0004(r27)
if it doesn't exist (null), skip the loading of it

move r12 into lr
move r27 into r3
branch to sub function

r12 contains pointer to scene sub function
it's executed at 0x801a40b0
801b16a8 - results screen
801b14a0 - vs menu
801b0ff8 - main menu
